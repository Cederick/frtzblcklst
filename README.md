# frtzblcklst
My personal list of blocked domains on my FRITZ!Box 7490

It was created to block mobile/smartphone ads and Skype ads.

apps.skype.com may disable some functions in Skype desktop!

Just login to your FRITZ!Box and you can find your Blacklist under the tab Lists.
Just copy&paste the text into your Blacklist and click on save.

These instructions are not made by AVM.
