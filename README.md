# frtzblcklst
My personal list of blocked domains on my FRITZ!Box 7490

It was created to block many mobile/smartphone In-App ads and Skype ads.

<h4>My Skype Home dosn't work anymore?</h4>

apps.skype.com may disable some functions in Skype desktop!

<h4>How can you use it?</h4>

Just login to your FRITZ!Box and you can find your Blacklist under the tab Lists. <br>
Copy&Paste the text into your Blacklist and click on save.

<h4>How to undo all of this?</h4>

Simply delete everythig you added from this list in your list.

And just to make sure<br>

<b>Usage at your own risk!</b>
